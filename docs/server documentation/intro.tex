\subsection{Project}
The wofa-backend\footnote{\url{https://github.com/maurice-herwig/wofa-backend}} project provides endpoints for all the computations provided by the WoFA\footnote{\url{https://github.com/maurice-herwig/wofa}} project to use this project as a microservice in a web architecture. More information about the project and the setup can be found on the GitHub pages. 

\subsection{Authorization}
The WoFa Backend allows only authenticated clients access to this to the services of this backend. To authenticate a client, we must register the new client as an application on the admin site. For this, visit the base\_url/admin site, login with the in the setup step created superuser and add a new application. By adding a new application, we see the following formula fill this with in the fig.~\ref{fig:add_application} seen data and save the client\_id and client\_secret. Important save the values before you save the new application, because after the save the client secret are hashed.

\subsubsection{POST o/ token/}

\textbf{Description:}\\
\ \\
To get access to all endpoints of this application, we need an access token. That every following request need as a header value. To get this access token, we must send a POST request to the o/token/ endpoint, with the clinet\_id and client\_secret. Important is that the tokens have a limited lifetime, so that we need a new one when the old one expires. The lifetime of a token can we see in the response at the expires\_in field in seconds. \\
\ \\
\textbf{Body:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item client\_id: $\langle$client\_id$\rangle$
    \item client\_secret: $\langle$client\_secret$\rangle$
    \item grant\_type: client\_credentials
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:} \\
